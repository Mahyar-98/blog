      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! I&apos;m Mahyar, an engineer turned self-taught web developer on
        a journey fueled by passion and curiosity. With a background in
        engineering and a love for coding, I&apos;ve embarked on an exciting
        adventure in the world of web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey began with a desire to bring my ideas to life, and it has
        since evolved into a deep passion for crafting elegant digital
        solutions. I thrive on challenges and love turning complex concepts into
        tangible products.
      </p>
      <p>
        With expertise in both frontend and backend development, I specialize in
        the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and Ruby on
        Rails. Whether it&apos;s building sleek user interfaces or architecting
        robust server-side systems, I&apos;m always up for the task.
      </p>
      <p>
        What excites me most about web development is the endless opportunity
        for learning and growth. The ever-evolving tech landscape keeps me on my
        toes, and I embrace the role of a lifelong student. Solving problems,
        experimenting with new technologies, and staying ahead in this
        fast-paced industry is what drives me forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m passionate about creating meaningful experiences and am eager
        to collaborate on projects that challenge the status quo and push
        boundaries. Let&apos;s work together to turn your ideas into reality!
      </p>
