          Hello! My name is Mahyar Erfanian and my pronouns are he/they.
          I&apos;ve taken a fascinating journey from engineering to the
          captivating realm of coding! Originally from the land of pistachios,
          sour cherries, and exquisite rugs, Iran, I have now settled in the
          vibrant city of Montreal. I&apos;m fueled by a strong desire to solve
          problems, which led me to switch gears and dive into web development
          after completing my Masters in Engineering. Turns out, coding is where
          I truly thrive!
        </p>
        <p>
          With expertise in both frontend and backend development, I specialize
          in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and Ruby on
          Rails. Whether it&apos;s building sleek user interfaces or engineering
          robust server-side systems, I&apos;m always up for the task.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I&apos;m not immersed in coding, you&apos;ll often find me
          exploring my passion for cooking, a practice that helps me preserve
          the cultural heritage I&apos;ve been raised with. I also find lots of
          joy in expressing my creativity through{" "}

          . Staying physically active is crucial in a career where long hours of
          sedentary work is common, so I prioritize regular workouts to maintain
          both my mental and physical well-being. Another passion close to my
          heart is music and I particularly enjoy delving into the lyrical depth
          of my favorite songs. Recently, I&apos;ve also begun writing a blog
          focused on topics related to web development, which serves as a means
          to continuously expand my knowledge and bridge any gaps in my
          understanding of the field.
        </p>
        <p>
          What excites me most about web development is the endless opportunity
          for learning and growth and I embrace the role of a lifelong student.
          I&apos;d love to create meaningful experiences and am eager to
          collaborate on projects that challenge me. Let&apos;s work together to
          turn your ideas into reality!
