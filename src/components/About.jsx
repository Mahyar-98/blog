          Hey there! My name is Mahyar Erfanian (he/they) and I love making web
          magic happen! My journey has taken me from the world of engineering to
          the exciting realm of coding (seriously, problem-solving is my jam!).
          When I decided to commit to being a coder for life, web development
          felt like the perfect gateway and I&apos;ve been absolutely head over
          heels for it ever since. Now I know for sure that coding is where I
          truly thrive!
        </p>

          I completed my bachelor&apos;s in chemical engineering in 2020 and
          master&apos;s in biomedical engineering in early 2023. I had all these
          coding projects all over my university years but it was not long
          before finishing my master&apos;s that I came into the realization
          that coding has been my favorite part of engineering all along!
          Learning and problem-solving is truly joyful to me and a career in
          coding could promise me all that for every day of my life, so I jumped
          right in with boundless motivation!

          I began self-teaching web development in late 2022. It was
          nerve-wracking at times not having a clear roadmap going the
          self-taught route but that definitely did not affect my passion.
          Despite challenges, I found reassurance in my decision every step of
          the way. Completing the curriculum of{" "}

          by March 2024, I built this website as my first-ever real-world
          project (after all, I&apos;m my own first customer!).
        </p>
        <p>
          This website serves as my introduction to fellow developers and
          potential collaborators! I am a full-stack web developer specialized
          in both MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and Ruby
          on Rails. This is also a place where I showcase my selected projects
          and share insights through blog posts. These posts are mostly about
          the challenges I face and how I tackle them, aiming to be of help to
          both myself by bridging my knowledge gaps through writing and anyone
          who is encountering similar issues.

          To expand on who I am, I come from the land of pistachios and
          exquisite rugs, Iran and have found a second home here in Montreal,
          Canada since 2021. While finding joy in the world of tech and science
          is and has been intentionally a big portion of my time, that is not my
          only passion. You might often find me in the kitchen, exploring my
          passion for cooking (a practice that helps me preserve my cherished
          cultural heritage). Additionally, from time to time, I indulge in the
          art of{" "}

          for leisure. Web development is my most recently-discovered passion,
          guiding me to where I am today.
        </p>
        <p>
          The opportunities to grow and learn in this field are endless and I am
          committed to being a lifelong student. I would love to collaborate on
          projects that challenge me and push me to new heights. Let&apos;s work
          together and transform your ideas into reality!
